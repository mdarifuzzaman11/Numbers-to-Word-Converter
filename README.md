# Number to word converter

## Prerequisites

This project uses the third-party library
[requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
as well as the `csv` module from the Python standard library.

## How to run the Script

To run this script, type

```
python numbers to word converter.py
```

in the directory where you have checked out these files.
(If you have an IDE which lets you run Python files,
and prefer to use that instead,
make sure you configure it to set the working directory to
the one which contains the input file.)
